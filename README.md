# vuetify-components
A repository of copy-paste components for working with Vuetify 

## What is this library?
Web applications often contain similar components that make up the user interface.
These elements of the application are well-known to users who browse many websites
each day, and many of them are included within the Vuetify Material UI library.
Having access to these components greatly reduces the need for boilerplate code
and duplicated effort among developers.

But there are several components that aren't included in the Vuetify library, but are
common among web applications. This library attempts to compile a collection of these
so developers can get stable, working UI components and move on to tasks unique to
their apps.  

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome, and it's likely that Vue developers of several experience
levels are capable of enhancing and improving the components here. Submit a pull
request and I'll do my best to review it for usefulness and add it in quickly!
